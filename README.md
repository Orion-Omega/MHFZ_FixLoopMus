# MHFZ_FixLoopMus

I created a little program to repair loops for all replacements of the original music files on your modded file!
Don't forget to put your "mhfo-hd.dll" file in the same directory as the program, when you start .exe it automatically opens a web page that directs you to mhf_mus_table.csv which will tell you the values unk0 and unk1.

If you want to put another music that is outside this one, unk0 or unk1 values is a sample, use Audacity

Enjoy !
